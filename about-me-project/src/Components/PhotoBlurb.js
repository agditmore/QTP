                    <p>I'm mostly a self-taught coder, and I like to spend my free time learning new skills. I received my MA in Classics from WashU and my BA in Classics and Linguistics from UNC Chapel Hill. My research focused on the use of meter and rhythm in ancient Roman Comedy and on the Delphic Oracle in Silver Age Latin poetry. I enjoy traveling, and my favorite trip was the summer that I worked as Trench Assistant at an archaeological dig at Azoria in eastern Crete, Greece. I enjoy coding because I love the opportunity to solve problems creatively. I'm most excited about the project phase and being able to contribute as a member of a group to accomplish a larger-scale solution to an ongoing problem.</p>
